## Insecure Docker Series
### Insecure Docker Registry II 

An unprotected private Docker registry is on the same network as your Kali machine. There is only one docker image present in the registry which contains the flag.
Objective: Fetch the image from the private Docker registry, analyze it and retrieve the flag!  No docker clients are provided and this exercise needs to be solved using first principles using curl.
Instructions: 
- This lab is dedicated to you! No other users are on this network :) 
- Once you start the lab, you will have access to a Kali terminal instance.
- Your Kali has an interface with IP address 192.X.Y.Z. Run "ip addr" to know the values of X and Y.
- The target server should be located at the IP address 192.X.Y.3. 
- Do not attack the gateway located at IP address 192.X.Y.1
